# XKE Akka Stream

# Step 1 : basics

Base Stream components
Basic operations
Materialized value

# Step 2 : parallelism

How do we use parallelism, can we batch elements ?

# Step 3 : error and failure

Error and Failure are distinct events :
 - Failure is supposed to be non-recoverable 'fatal' error
 - Error is 'normal' error than can be part of the business logic
How do we work with those ?

# Step 4 : under the hood

Let's implement lower level APIs

# Step 5 : graph shapes

Let's implement a more complex graph shape
